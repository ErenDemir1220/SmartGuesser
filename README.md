Smart Guesser
This project is a Java application that attempts to guess the number in the classic MasterMind game. The user plays a game where the computer, called "Smart Guesser," tries to guess a four-digit number selected by the user.

Features
The Smart Guesser attempts to guess the four-digit number chosen by the user.
The user provides feedback indicating how many digits are correct and in the right position ("+") and how many digits are correct but in the wrong position ("-").
Based on the feedback, the Smart Guesser eliminates possible numbers and makes new guesses.

Usage
When the program starts, think of a four-digit number and then confirm by typing "OK."

The Smart Guesser will continue to make guesses based on your feedback until it finds your number.
